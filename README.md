# Timesheet
Timesheet application for sole freelancer - this is not a whole team solution.
This is a solution for freelancers working for longer time for a single client.

Timesheet is a single PHP file. It expects a data folder to save:
- client name
- manager name
Data folder is simply called data and should have your webserver user as user:group, most commonly:
www-data:www-data
The settings, and every timesheet will be saved as a single json file.
